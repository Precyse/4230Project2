When you run the game, you are in a blank room with a single red / white dot, use WASD to move over the dot then press "E", this will take you to the boss room.

In the boss room you can move with WASD, Space to Jump, left click to do a single fire attack, and right click to do a spread attack. You can also press f to dash.
