The game starts with an intro screen that leads into a brief game narrative and then into the tutorial which teaches you the basic game mechanics. The main character has to collect all three record pieces.

From the tutorial you go to the main room where you can access two houses and a pit that take you to each boss room. All bosses will be unlocked from the beginning and you can choose which boss you want to fight first.

During a boss fight, the player only has three lives, meaning that they have to be very careful in order to avoid losing their lives quickly and get defeated. When you get defeated by a boss you can choose to either retry, or go back to the main room to try a different boss. Once you defeat a boss you will be able to pickup the disk piece that will take you back to the main room where you can fight the next boss.

Once you defeat all the bosses and have the three record pieces, you win.

Boss Strategy Guide:

Boss 1: This boss shoots three different kinds of projectiles. One is a horizontal projectile that originates from the boss. The other is an undulating projectile that goes up and down. The third one is another horizontal projectile but this one sweeps either the top platforms or the ground, returning like a boomerang to the boss. Once the boss is at less than 60% health, the second phase activates. During the second phase the ground is no longer available due to the boss's projectiles meaning that the player will have to maneuver through the three top platforms.
The key to beating this boss is to either stay far away and use the long range projectiles, or get close before the second phase and use the close range projectiles to deal a lot of damage.
Boss 2: This boss shoots a lot of projectiles and does damage if you get close. The key is to stay far away while dodging the projectiles.
Boss 3: This boss has three ways to attack. A fireball that forces you to jump or stay on the ground. The boss moving which you have to jump over. Summoning bats which will track slightly toward the player. The player can shoot the bats to destroy them.
